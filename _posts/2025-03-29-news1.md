In the field of flexible sensors, the development of multifunctional, highly sensitive, wide detection range, and excellent durability sensors remains a significant challenge. This paper designs and fabricates a dual-mode ion gel sensor based on the spider’s sensing mechanism, integrating both wind speed and pressure detection. The wind speed sensor employs magnetic fiber flocking and inductive resonance principles, providing accurate detection within a wind speed range of 2 m/s to 11.5 m/s, with good linear response and high sensitivity. The impedance signal exhibits a maximum variation of 6.89 times. The pressure sensor, combining microstructured ion gel and capacitive design, demonstrates high sensitivity (15.93 kPa⁻¹) and excellent linear response within a pressure range of 0.5 Pa to 40 kPa, with strong adaptability and good stability. The sensor shows outstanding performance in human motion monitoring, accurately capturing physiological signals such as joint movements and respiratory frequency, offering robust support for motion health management. Furthermore, combined with deep learning algorithms, the sensor achieves an accuracy of 96.83% in an intelligent motion recognition system, effectively enhancing the precision of motion performance analysis. This study provides a new solution for flexible motion monitoring and health management systems, with broad application prospects.
