    title: "Continued Learning"
    excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">​We investigate how systems can continuously acquire and refine knowledge over time—a process known as continued learning. Our research focuses on utilizing analytic learning to develope methods that can adapt to new information without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Ultimately, our goal is to design scalable learning frameworks that support lifelong learning, facilitating applications in areas such as adaptive robotics and intelligent decision-making systems.</p>'

    title: "Embodied Intelligence"
    excerpt: |
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Embodied intelligence is a research approach that emphasizes the integration of an agent's physical form (its "body") with its control systems (its "brain") to enable intelligent behavior. This concept highlights how the body's shape, materials, and interactions with the environment contribute to cognition and decision-making processes. We develop AI-based control methods that work in harmony with an agent's physical characteristics. These methods enhance performance and adaptability, allowing systems to respond effectively to dynamic environments. </p>

    title: "Large Language Models (LLMs)"
    excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">we investigate large language models (LLMs), focusing on their architectural innovations, training strategies, and applications in natural language processing tasks. Our research aims to understand how LLMs can be integrated into embodied systems, enabling more natural and efficient interactions between agents and their environments</p>'

    title: "Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)"
    excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">​Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are versatile hardware devices that can be programmed to perform specific tasks efficiently. Unlike fixed-function hardware, FPGAs can be reconfigured after manufacturing, allowing for adaptability in various applications.​

Our lab focuses on leveraging FPGAs to accelerate computational tasks across domains such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and embedded systems. We explore how FPGAs can be tailored to optimize performance and energy efficiency for specific applications.</p>'
